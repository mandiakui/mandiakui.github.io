# Driving growth with sustainable, climate positive, energy microgrids

Start Kits are so named because they can grow incrementally, expanding digital
services, electrical power, and other dimensions of national, health, financial,
and cyber security.

Start Kits grow into full Digital Transformation platforms through the integration
of additional power generating, 5G, self-sustaining micro-data centers supporting
the expansion of government and civil society services.

Each Mandiakui micro-grid node adds to the collective electrical grid, compute-grid,
network services grid, in addition to providing a key service from domains such as
health care, education, and civil administration.
