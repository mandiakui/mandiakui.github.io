Mandiakui Microgrids are excessively self-powering.  They provide a net
electricity input into the local community.  The power generation is primarily
solar, although wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric sources can be adapted
as appropriate.

# Locality Principle

Power generation and consumption should be tightly coupled, with appropriate
sustainable generation for an appropriately local community.  This form of power
generation is more easily sustainable, and often provides additional benefits.

For example, the use of a hydrogen fuel cell to store solar energy transforms
sunlight into additional oxygen for the environment, and, when it is burnt, produces
clean water as a result.

This solution is not well suited for arid environments, where water is at a premium
and is an expensive raw material.  A long storage solid state battery may be ideal.

Mandiakui provides a wide range of power generation and storage options.
Each solution and is adapted to local conditions, but all are unified using
Mandiakui's AI-powered, IoT fed, power production and consumption management
tools.
