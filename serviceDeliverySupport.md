## Citizen Service Structures

the digital economy and the digital dimension of the services provided
by the government.

## Health Parity Centers

A Health Parity Center can be deployed to provide basic cross-border health management
and monitoring the migration of infectious agents.  In these contexts, communities
gain the ability to provide a small suite of verifiable medical tests and
effectively share that information throughout the community,
regardless of their side of the border.  The border community itself becomes a
resilient first point of defense in pandemic matters.

Health Parity Centers are not, themselves, general purpose epidemic or disaster
response services.  However, they are ready for integration with disaster and
epidemic response systems, making critical care services available faster, better,
and cheaper.
