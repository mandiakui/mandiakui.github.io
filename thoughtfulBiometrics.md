Mandiakui is mindful of the following four principles:

1. Biometrics are collected without the use of a central registry.

2. Biometrics are collected without physical contact

3. Biometrics are immediately encoded and encrypted by the local authority

4. Raw capture and derived data is never recorded in any database.

The roll of the biometric service provider is well defined, and the
Mandiakui RDDT is designed to block vendor-lock and facilitate vendor
transition as devices, algorithms, and capabilities improve.

With no central biometric enrolment database there is no value in hacking
the system for identity theft, and there is no ability to perform 1:N
identification checks - the system only allows biometric authentication
and never biometric identification.  This reduces liability exposure,
cyberattack risk, and dramatically reduces the operating and capital cost
of the solution data center.

A specific deployment may include any or all of the following :

 * face

 * fingerprint

 * palm vein

 * iris

 * voice (specifically for duress-detection)
