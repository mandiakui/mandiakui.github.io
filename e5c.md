Every station generates its own electricity, and connects a
micro data center to a secure, digitally sovereign 5G network.
Additional power generation, as required to support the data
processing requirements of the community (border, trade, taxation,
civil services, etc.)  These additional power generation facilities
can provide electricity and vital services, such as water purification
or aquifer access to stable refrigeration of medicines.

Each power station is connected to the civil service community 5G
network, either as a producer or a consumer/repeater.  5G producers include
a military-grade, multi-tenant, tenant-monitored data center.  These
micro-data centers provide the fabric upon which the community undertakes
its digital transformation journey.  The self-sustaining, environmentally
positive electricity generation forms an energy microgrid which is highly
resilient, fault-tolerant, and adaptive.

The 5G bubble provides a set of core services, such as:

* MDM

  Communities fund, provide, and maintain a fleet of tablets, phones, and
  similar digital technology.  This fleet is locked down and for official
  purposes only, and access to the device is based on biometrics.

* Country-Specific Applications

   * Single Window Gateways, biometrically secured
   * Official Payments Gateway, to enable payment of government fees, taxes
     or other costs and retain a biometrically linked

It is always worth remembering that, in Mandiakui design a personal digital
device is never a requirement, merely a luxury.  100% of the digital
transformation must not require individuals to manage electronic devices.
