    * medical facilities - from triage, to recovery, to operating theaters, to pandemic management, and beyond

    * educational facilities - supporting training, capacity building facilities

    * digitally rigorous stress relief on struggling institutions, such as over-burdened hospitals or immigration detention

    * e-Estonian driven digital transformation of government services

    * topical international data sharing based on e-Estonia's X-Road

    * aggresstive cybersecurity threat minimization through active surveillance and pursuit.

    title: "Digital Sovereignty and International Interoperability"
    excerpt: "Mandiakui Service Communities are digitally sovereign in that
    they are cryptographically isolated from the rest of the internet.  In
    fact, they work completely without any other systems.  The 5G network
    bubble generated by the microgrid is cryptographically isolated from
    other digital systems and only registered devices may be connected.

    However, they come
    equipped with adapters capable of connecting to a complete range of
    local communities, national systems, international organizations, and
    other global entities

    preconfigured
    to interact with a selectable range of national, international, and
    global entities using the e-Estonian X-Road protocol.  Naturally, Mandiakui
    Transformed Microgrid Communities

    This means that each microgrid deployment is ready
    for integration with all other national microgrids as well as with
    international organizations, or, in the case of border microgrids, with adjacent states.  Preconfiguration for integration with crises response
    systems increases the resiliency of the communities to absorb the shocks
    from nearby political or climate disasters.

Mandiakui coordinates the rapid and incremental deployment of power
generation and 5G supported dignified digital ecosystems.
Each Mandiakui station generates electricity, provides compute,
includes a 5G signal tower, and provides a physical
point of administration for a social service.

{% include feature_row id="these_three_trees" %}

Each Mandiakui Station
 * supports functional biometric identity for up to 1 million people
   without introducing ABIS overhead or vendor-bindings of any sort.
 * defines a service-driven digital sovereignty (i.e. patient/doctor,
   SSCBT-professional, etc.) using
   the e-Estonian open-source X-Road system
 * enhances and extends a managed 5G bubble serving the community
 * can provide tamper-proof biometric voter registration and election
   support services
 * improves community compute power, data resilience, and data depth
 * establishes clear public and private data spaces, governed by formal
   digital rights preserving, procedurally managed, history preserving
   automated legal engine.
 * supports best-practice data sharing, privacy, and personal rights
   protection using interoperable verifiable credentials
 * generates more than the electricity to power a data-processing 5G
   extender, as well as an associated service structure.
   Service Examples Include:
     * small school
     * operating theater or small clinic
     * border management facilities
     * pandemic/epidemic response
     * baseline-health-parity (early warning system)
     * acquatic sustainability
     * other resource sustainability efforts
     * other e-Government facilities

Mandiakui...

 * *defines* a self-powering, cryptographically secured, digital
   service suite.  Following the e-Estonian model, the
   infrastructure for this digital community is procured, installed,
   financed, legally represented by, and managed by
   a public/private partnership.  This entity is, in effect, digitally
   sovereign - but, in no way, physically sovereign.


 * *digitally transforms* communities through the deployment of green
   power generation, managed 5G, as-needed functional architecture, and
   combat-vetted secure micro-data centers.  The data centers support
   the regular migration of local community needs from paper based to
   biometrically bound e-Government processes.

 * *engages* nearby communities, national digital systems, as well
   as civil society, regional and international organizations.  For example,
   the UNIOM MIDAS adapter and the UNHCR PRIMES adapter ensure the community
   is prepared for engagement.

 * *enhances* the human condition where best-practices
   and civil society are already part of the legal firmament
   but where natural, technical, or civil society infrastructure
   is lacking.

 * *protects* border regions by establishing _critical health parity_
   on all sides of a border, transparently sharing health data in accordance
   with leading-practices in personal data management, privacy, and resistance
   to misuse, while enabling rapid integration of pandemic and epidemic
   management.

 * *stabilizes* border regions by providing a point of mutual interest in the
   event bordering nations engage in conflict.

Mandiakui reduces the risk of future crises by facilitating incremental
digital transformation and strengthening communities in challenging
multistakeholder environments such as remote borders & ports, municipalities,
and small island developing states.
