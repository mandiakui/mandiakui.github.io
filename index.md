Mandiakui supports coordinated, rapid deployment
of combined power generation, 5G, and physical structures supporting
a community-scale digitally transformed civil service - such as small
scale cross border community trade, pandemic rapid response,
civil registration and vital stastics, education, civil service
administration, and financial inclusion.


Each Mandiakui station generates electricity, provides compute,
includes a 5G signal tower, and provides a physical
structure supporting the delivery of civil services.
Mandiakui stations may be deployed incrementally as part of national and regional
programs of digital transformation.  Mandiakui stations coordinate data using
the internationally established e-Estonian X-Road.

Mandiakui's goal is to strengthen healthy communities in
challenging environments, ensuring that communities can respond
well to pressures from climate change, pandemics, and
global political instability.

# Digital Transformation Engine

## Each Mandiakui Station
 * supports functional biometric identity for up to 1 million people
   without introducing either a central database or a perpetual vendor.
 * defines [a service-driven digital sovereignty]()
   which regulates data
   and credential exchange between well known parties - for example:
     * personal health records and doctor/patient digital relationships
     * labor motility within the community, especially if it crosses national
       boundaries
     * cross border law enforcement and national security data exchange
     * trade facilitation and tax collection, including payment integration
     * health and education services and facilities
     * government administration for the community
     * biometric voter registration and verifiable elections

   [details of how this works](/underTheHood)

 * enhances and extends a managed 5G bubble serving the community
 * improves community compute power, data resilience, and data depth, with
   each node adding to the community 5G accessible digital economy
 * establishes legally well defined and cryptographically protected
   public and private data spaces suitable for managing sensitive data
   such as doctor/patient private discussions or national security records
 * supports best-practice data sharing, privacy, and personal rights
   protection using interoperable verifiable credentials and adhering to
   strong EU/MyData principles.
 * generates excess electricity beyond that can help:
     * small schools
     * operating theaters or small clinics
     * border management facilities
     * pandemic/epidemic monitoring and response systems
     * water and other resource sustainability efforts
     * incremental national migration to e-Government


## A Mandiakui Microgrid  

 * *defines* a self-powering, cryptographically secured, digital
   service suite.  Following the e-Estonian model, the
   infrastructure for this digital community is procured, installed,
   financed, legally represented by, and managed by
   a public/private partnership.  This entity is, in effect, digitally
   sovereign - but, in no way, physically sovereign.


 * *digitally transforms* communities through the deployment of green
   power generation, managed 5G, as-needed functional architecture, and
   combat-vetted secure micro-data centers.  The data centers support
   the regular migration of local community needs from paper based to
   biometrically bound e-Government processes.

 * *engages* nearby communities, national digital systems, as well
   as civil society, regional and international organizations.  For example,
   the UNIOM MIDAS adapter and the UNHCR PRIMES adapter ensure the community
   is prepared for engagement.

 * *enhances* the human condition where best-practices
   and civil society are already part of the legal firmament
   but where natural, technical, or civil society infrastructure
   is lacking.

 * *protects* border regions by establishing _critical health parity_
   on all sides of a border, transparently sharing health data in accordance
   with leading-practices in personal data management, privacy, and resistance
   to misuse, while enabling rapid integration of pandemic and epidemic
   management.

 * *stabilizes* border regions by providing a point of mutual interest in the
   event bordering nations engage in conflict.

Mandiakui reduces the risk of future crises by facilitating incremental
digital transformation and strengthening communities in challenging
multistakeholder environments such as remote borders & ports, municipalities,
and small island developing states.
