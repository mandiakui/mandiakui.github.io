Mandiakui Service Communities are digitally sovereign in that
they are cryptographically isolated from the rest of the internet.  In
fact, they work completely without any other systems.  The 5G network
bubble generated by the microgrid is cryptographically isolated from
other digital systems and only registered devices may be connected.


However, they come
equipped with adapters capable of connecting to a complete range of
local communities, national systems, international organizations, and
other global entities
preconfigured
to interact with a selectable range of national, international, and
global entities using the e-Estonian X-Road protocol.


This means that each microgrid deployment is ready
for integration with all other national microgrids as well as with
international organizations, or, in the case of border microgrids, with adjacent states.  Preconfiguration for integration with crises response
systems increases the resiliency of the communities to absorb the shocks
from nearby political or climate disasters.
